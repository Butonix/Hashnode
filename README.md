# Hashnode Clone

This is a **full-stack application** that serves as a clone of the popular blogging website, _Hashnode_. The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills in web development and serve as a learning experience. I have utilized Next.js, Nextjs, Tailwind CSS, and the T3 stack with PostgreSQL as the technology stack for this project. With a plethora of exciting features, this intermediate-level project replicates most of the functionalities found on the original Hashnode website. I hope you enjoy this project as much as I enjoyed building it. Cheers üçª. Contributions are welcome!

# [[APP] Hashnode using React-native.](https://github.com/ujen5173/hashnode-rn)

I'm creating Hashnode in React Native from the ground up, using React Native, Tailwind, and MongoDB. If you're curious about the project's progress, check it out! If you enjoy it, give it a star. This is my first time diving into React Native, so it's a bit of a challenge for me.
